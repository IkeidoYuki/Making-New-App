# Generated Assets

The PNG files used by the Expo configuration are generated at install time by
`scripts/prepare-assets.js`. The script creates lightweight placeholder images
so that binary assets do not need to be committed to the repository. You can
run the script manually with:

```bash
npm run prepare-assets
```

If you want to replace any of the generated images with custom artwork, simply
place your own PNG files in this directory before starting the Expo app.
Existing files are never overwritten by the script.
